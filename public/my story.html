<h1>My Story</h1>
I worked a lot since I turned 18. I would summarize that part of story<br />
which took place before me become a web developer.
I did a lot of<br />
sales job in my life and actually I am good at it, but now
when<br /> it comes to sales again, I feel very bad about it. <br />
<br />
When I was a child, I always dreamed about being a developer<br />
who is sitting behind the computer and runs the whole world.<br />
I would always loved being a software engineer but I don't know <br />
what happened to me that I chose another engineering major and <br />
more than that, to become a sales expert that doing it makes me sick now.
<br /><br />
Eventually, I made up my mind and decided to be a developer<br />
in order to enjoy my job for the rest of my life.<br />
Now, that I learned about programming and web development,<br />
believe it or not, I'm very happy. I wake up with motivation<br />
in the morning and the whole day I have so much energy for doing<br />
this kind of tasks.
